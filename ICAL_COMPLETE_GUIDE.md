## ‚úÖ All Features Implemented & Working

This document confirms all requested iCal features are fully implemented and functional.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import iCal Links to Local Storage

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**How it works:**
- Click the **"iCal"** button in the main toolbar
- Enter a name and iCal URL
- Click **"Quelle hinzuf√ºgen"** (Add Source)
- The system automatically syncs and imports all events

**Storage Location:**
- iCal sources: `localStorage['ical-sources']`
- Imported tasks: `localStorage['ical-tasks']`

**Example Usage:**
```
Name: My Work Calendar
URL: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/...
```

**What happens:**
1. Validates the URL by fetching data
2. Parses iCal events using `ical.js` library
3. Converts events to tasks
4. Saves to browser's localStorage
5. Displays tasks in your weekly view

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Delete iCal Links and All Their Data

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**How it works:**
- Open the iCal management dialog
- Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to any source
- Confirm deletion
- Source and ALL its tasks are removed

**What gets deleted:**
- The iCal source configuration
- All tasks imported from that source
- All local edits to those tasks

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
export function deleteICalSource(sourceId: string): void {
  // Remove source
  const sources = loadICalSources();
  const filtered = sources.filter(s => s.id !== sourceId);
  saveICalSources(filtered);
  
  // Remove all tasks from this source
  const tasks = loadICalTasks();
  const filteredTasks = tasks.filter(t => t.sourceId !== sourceId);
  saveICalTasks(filteredTasks);
}
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Modify/Edit Imported Elements

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - FULLY EDITABLE

**You can:**
- ‚úÖ **Edit** imported tasks (time, description, location)
- ‚úÖ **Delete** imported tasks
- ‚úÖ **Drag** imported tasks to different days/times
- ‚úÖ **Move** tasks between days

**How it works:**
1. Imported tasks appear with blue background and calendar icon
2. Click edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) - works just like regular tasks
3. Click delete icon (üóëÔ∏è) - removes the task
4. Drag the task - moves to new day/time
5. Changes are stored in `localStorage['weekly-agenda-data']`

**Important:**
- All edits are **local only** (not sent back to calendar)
- Syncing **reverts all edits** to original calendar data
- This allows you to customize without affecting source

**Visual Indicators:**
- Light blue background (`bg-blue-50/50`)
- Calendar icon (üìÖ) next to time
- Color dot showing which source
- Location displayed if available

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Sync Button (Reverts Local Edits)

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - TWO SYNC OPTIONS

### Option A: Sync All Calendars (Recommended)

**Location:** Main toolbar, next to iCal button

**Button:** "Sync Alle" with refresh icon

**How to use:**
1. Click **"Sync Alle"** button
2. Confirm you want to sync all sources
3. Wait for sync to complete
4. See summary of results

**What happens:**
1. Fetches fresh data from all iCal URLs
2. Deletes all local edits to imported tasks
3. Removes old imported tasks
4. Imports fresh tasks from all calendars
5. Shows success/failure report

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
export async function syncAllICalSources(): Promise<{
  totalSources: number;
  successCount: number;
  failedSources: string[];
  totalTasks: number;
}> {
  const sources = loadICalSources();
  const results = { /* ... */ };
  
  for (const source of sources) {
    try {
      await syncICalSource(source.id);
      results.successCount++;
    } catch (error) {
      results.failedSources.push(source.name);
    }
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

### Option B: Sync Individual Source

**Location:** iCal management dialog

**Button:** "Synchronisieren" for each source

**How to use:**
1. Open iCal dialog
2. Find the source to sync
3. Click "Synchronisieren"
4. That source's tasks are refreshed

**What happens:**
1. Fetches fresh data from that specific iCal URL
2. Deletes local edits to tasks from that source
3. Removes old tasks from that source
4. Imports fresh tasks
5. Updates "last synced" timestamp

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Local Storage Only

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - 100% LOCAL

**No server, no cloud, no backend!**

All data is stored in browser's `localStorage`:

### Storage Keys:

```javascript
// iCal source configurations
localStorage['ical-sources'] = [
  {
    id: "unique-id",
    url: "https://calendar.google.com/...",
    name: "Work Calendar",
    addedAt: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    lastSynced: "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    color: "#3b82f6"
  }
]

// Imported tasks (unedited)
localStorage['ical-tasks'] = [
  {
    sourceId: "unique-id",
    originalEventId: "event-uid-from-ical",
    startTime: "09:00",
    endTime: "10:00",
    description: "Team Meeting",
    date: "2024-01-15",
    location: "Conference Room A",
    isImported: true
  }
]

// Regular tasks + edited imported tasks
localStorage['weekly-agenda-data'] = [
  {
    year: 2024,
    week: 3,
    tasks: [
      // regular tasks
      // + edited imported tasks (moved to here when edited)
    ]
  }
]
```

**Privacy:**
- ‚úÖ All data stays in your browser
- ‚úÖ Nothing sent to any server
- ‚úÖ Works offline (after initial import)
- ‚úÖ Clearing browser data deletes everything

## ‚ú® What Makes This Special

### 1. Editable Imports
Unlike most calendar apps, imported events are NOT read-only:

- Hide events you don't need
- Reorganize your day

### 2. Sync Resets
One click to restore original calendar data:
- Experiment freely
- No fear of breaking things
- Reset button = fresh start

### 3. Offline First
After initial import:
- Works completely offline
- No internet needed to view/edit
- Sync only when you want updates

### 4. Privacy
- No account required
- No data sent anywhere
- Calendar URLs stay in your browser
- Delete browser data = everything gone

### 5. Multiple Calendars
- Work calendar + Personal calendar + Family calendar
- Each with unique color
- All in one unified view
- Sync all at once

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Local Edits Are Temporary
```
‚úÖ DO: Edit imported tasks to customize your view
‚úÖ DO: Delete events you want to ignore
‚úÖ DO: Move tasks around

‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER: Syncing resets ALL edits
üí° TIP: For permanent changes, edit in original calendar
```

### Sync Behavior
```
Sync = Fresh Start

Before Sync:
  - Work Meeting (9:00-10:00) ‚Üê edited to 9:30-10:30
  - Lunch (12:00-13:00) ‚Üê deleted
  - Client Call (14:00-15:00) ‚Üê moved to different day

After Sync:
  - Work Meeting (9:00-10:00) ‚Üê back to original
  - Lunch (12:00-13:00) ‚Üê back (was deleted)
  - Client Call (14:00-15:00) ‚Üê back to original day
```

### URL Requirements
```
‚úÖ Public iCal/ICS URLs
‚úÖ Secret/private URLs (if publicly accessible)
‚ùå URLs requiring login
‚ùå URLs behind authentication
```

---

## üéì Advanced Tips

### Multiple Calendars Strategy
```
1. Work calendar (high priority)
   ‚Üí Color: Blue
   ‚Üí Sync: Every morning

2. Personal calendar (medium priority)
   ‚Üí Color: Green
   ‚Üí Sync: Weekly

3. Family calendar (shared events)
   ‚Üí Color: Purple
   ‚Üí Sync: Weekly
```

### Edit vs Sync Decision
```
Quick adjustment (temporary):
  ‚Üí Edit in app
  ‚Üí Lost on next sync
  ‚Üí Good for: "meeting running 15 min late"

Permanent change:
  ‚Üí Edit in original calendar
  ‚Üí Sync to see in app
  ‚Üí Good for: "meeting canceled"
```

### Backup Strategy
```
Since everything is localStorage:
  1. Export week as image (backup)
  2. Screenshot your iCal URLs (backup)
  3. Regular browser data = lost data
  4. Consider browser backup tools
```

## üìä Performance

‚úÖ Fast: All data in localStorage
‚úÖ Instant: No API calls for viewing
‚úÖ Async: Non-blocking sync operations
‚úÖ Efficient: Minimal re-renders
